This add-on just adds a reboot button to the menu bar. (Prototype)

## Warning

- This add-on is separated from Anki in purpose of restarting Anki, so there is a high possibility of mis-detection by antivirus software. This problem is solvable, but requires $200+ per year (Code Signing), so I'm not considering it at now.
- **[Windows]** If your antivirus software mis-detects add-on, the ".exe" will be quarantined. It's labeled Trojan but it's a mis-detection, so no danger. In this case, this add-on cannot be used without Allow on device.
- **[Mac]** If you do not grant permissions, it is likely that you will not be able to launch the ".app". I'm not certain if it will work on the latest Macs.
